This is the Code to our Final Project in the Girls Who Code Summer immersion program in 2019.
All of this files will be a website without any pictures because the pictures were saved to a
personal computer before being added to the code.
This Website is supposed to be an outlet for young women who do not have a female influence in their life. 
For this website we wanted a drop-down in our side bar to add more topics however we ran out of time. We
also wanted to add an interactive period tracking calendar, but we were unsure on how to make it work. 
All of the links and resources should work fine.
